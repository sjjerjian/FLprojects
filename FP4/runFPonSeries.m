% Runs the Fokker-Planck to bounds through a series of stimulus difficulties.
% Just a wrapper to run through a coherence series to generate
% probability surface in time under boundary conditions.
%
% Input args
% ~~~~~~~~~~
% uvect vector of the mean drift rates
% t     time axis. Typically [0:dt:tmax] where dt is 0.05 and tmax is
%       whatever you choose
% Bup and Blo are the upper and lower bounds (same dimension as t)
% y0    starting value of the accumulation; zero by default.
%
% dependencies: FP4.mex (from Roozbeh Kiani) or a slightly modified version
% FP4_BoundCrossZero.mex. I think either will work now because roozbeh made
% some adjustments fto FP4.
%
% return args
% ~~~~~~~~~~~
% pUpAbs  for each x member of uvect, prob of absorption at upper bound
% rtUp    for each x member of uvect, the mean time of absorption at upper bound
% rtLo    for each x member of uvect, the mean time of absorption at lower bound
% upDist  for each x member of uvect, the probability distribution of bound
%         crossings at upper bound (cell array of vectors size of t)
% loDist  for each x member of uvect, the probability distribution of bound
%         crossings at upper bound (cell array of vectors size of t)
% pLoAbs  see pUpAbs (see below)
% dvNotAbs  for each x member of uvect, the distribution of the
%           non-absorbed decision variable at t=tmax. This is a column
%           vector that corresponds to the values of xmesh, which is the
%           grid formed within the FP routine. It's not available, but I
%           haven't needed it.
% pGT0     for each x member of uvect, a vector that is the total
%           probability above 0 at each time step. I think this includes
%           absorbed probability. It's useful for calculations in non-RT
%           experiments when a decision is based on the sign of the dv
%           (cell array of vectors size of t)
% xtDist   for each x member of uvect, a matrix containing the
%          probabability of the dv at each time. I can't remember what's
%          stored at the bounds. This is a huge matrix because its
%          dimensions are size of t by the mesh that separates the upper
%          and lower bounds. (cell array of matrices)


% I added the pLoAbs return argument later mainly to help cross check that
% the sum of the total choice probability is 1. 
% 1 - rtUp(i) + rtLo(i) should be equal to the total probabability of
% nonAbsorbed decision variable at tmax, which is sum(dvNotAbs{i}) 

% 5/30/08 mns wrote it
% 12/13/08 mns changed pcor to pUpAbs; added pLoAbs and dvNotAbs
% 6/23/09 mns added pGT0 argout
% 8/26/09 updated documentation
