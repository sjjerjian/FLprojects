% 
% Description:
% 
% 	Propagates the probability density <uinit> on the spatial grid <xmesh> across time, using the diffusion
%    parameters k (drift rate) and sigma (diffusion standard deviation). The duration of the propagation is
%    defined by dt and size of [lb_change ub_change] (see below). Don't include Pxt in the output arguments
%    to keep memory management efficient and fast.

% input ->  [xmesh]						//a column vector specifying the spatial grid for probability density propagation in space

%                                       //high values (upper bound + ub_margin - dx). xmesh should be regular. define it as:

%                         				// of crossing the upper and lower boundaries separately we should reduce xinit and increase xend by 
%                                       // many folds of sigma and calculate how much of the probability falls beyond the actual target boundaries.
%                         				// lb_margin and ub_margin define the distance of the actual boundaries from xinit and xend (the starting
