% this creates a big struct containing neural activity and information from
% rigB (dots3DMP recordings)
% user should specify the subject, dateRange, and paradigms to draw from
%
% organization of dataCell is as follows:
%
% 1 - each row in dataCell pertains to one recording 'session' (block/set) (in practice, this means each day)
% 2 - within a row, 
%       info field, with header information, 
%       data field
% data field is further split into fields for each paradigm, with each
% paradigm field containing:
%   'events' condition information for each trial, as well as the timing of key stimulus and behavioral events)
%   'pldaps' useful pldaps information for each trial, largely bookkeeping
%   'cluster_id' 1 x N ids from Kilosort, where N = number of clusters
%   'cluster_type' 1 x N, 1 - MU, 2 - SU, 3 - noise (3 is skipped out, MU
%   will also be skipped if keepMU below == 0)
%   'spiketimes' 1 x N cell array containing spike times in seconds for
%   each cluster, within the range of the given paradigm
%
% Note that each unique row of dataCell pertains to an individual 'set' of
% recordings - there could be more than one for a given day.
% Recordings are grouped by set, so multiple dots3DMP paradigms recorded in
% one set will be combined, whether the actual recording was done in
% multiple Trellis files or a single one - rec_group in info is therefore
% critical!
% The timestamps for concatenated recordings are shifted according to the
% length of the overall data so that the range of events and spikes is
% matched for a given recording (nsEvents.analogData.timeStamps).
% i.e. if a recording is the first in the set, it's timestamps should start
% from near 0, if it is later in the set they will start from some other
% time.
%
%
% TODO 
% - add option to append to existing dataCell
% - add more useful metadata to info?
% - key fields from info should get their own field in dataCell rows?
% - exclusion criteria for cells
%   - cluster_type, but also numSpikes/spikerate, presence in all
%   paradigms if selected for?
%
%
%
% SJ 06-2022 significant updates
%           Fixed issues with processing of mksort data, timestamps of
%           multiple recordings. 
%           Switched dataCell from {} to dataStruct () struct format.
