%Modified 12may2016 by Adam Snyder: For the new method of calibration
%(i.e., without the pixelsPerMV field), apparently we need to divide the
%raw voltage value in half before performing the regression. Not sure why
%the values seem to be doubled when saving to trellis yet, but this does
%work. -acs
%
%NOTE: We fixed the voltage doubling issue. There are only a few files
%where pixelsPerMV doesn't exist but the voltage is stored as double.
%Should update this.
%
% As of Jan 11, 2017, we think we've covered all cases of eye2deg
% conversion in Smith Lab History. This supercedes all previous eye2deg
% conversions and should work for every file. Most recent addition was
% dealing with the files where pixelsPerMV needed to be divided by 2 or
% not (Jan 2016 issues).
%
% 26jan2017: I found that 'voltScale' wasn't actually sent in my more
% recent files, whereas 'displayPixelSize' was, so I changed the conditional
% expression to this value. -acs26jan2017
